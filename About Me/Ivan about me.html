        <h3>1. Who am I? What is one thing about me?</h3>
        <p>My name is Ivan. I love to draw, I spend most my time drawing.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Why did I take this class? What do you plan on achieving?</h3>
        <p>I am taking this class because I originally had nothing to do over the summer and coding was always interesting to me so I decided to take this class. I want to be able to create something cool by the end of this class. Perhaps a small game?</p>

        <h3>3. What am I good at? What am I not good at?</h3>
        <p>I think I'm good at drawing and piano, perhaps at soccer as well. I am, however, rather bad at keeping time and self control.</p>

        <h3>4. What is my dream?</h3>
        <p> My dream is to live comfortably. </p>
        
        <h3>5. Why is technology important?</h3>
        <p>I think technology is important because it makes everyday actions more efficient, it connects us with the world, and it allows for people to innovate and create.</p>
        
        <h3>What is one thing that annoys me about technology?</h3>
        <p>The wifi stopped working...</p>
